# String-Matching

Our application provides an intuitive and visual explanation of three key string-searching algorithms:

Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), Boyer-Moore (BM), and Rabin-Karp (RK).

It demonstrates how these algorithms work and optimizes string matching through interactive simulations.

Additionally, the app simplifies DNA sequence analysis by applying these algorithms to a simulated DNA dataset.

This showcases their real-world use in bioinformatics and large-scale data processing.

With a user-friendly interface and clear examples, our app makes complex algorithms accessible to beginners and practical for real-world applications.
